Hundreds of years from now you’re remembered as a legend, what do people call you and what deeds did you perform?		8	https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/katefy/hundreds_of_years_from_now_youre_remembered_as_a/	2.0	1.5	[4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1]	0.16666666666666666	0.0	[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]	"I don't know if it's true or not, but I remember when I was in high school, I had a friend who used to call me by his name, and when he called me, he asked me if I wanted to go to the bathroom, so I said no, because I didn't want to be there. I told him that I'd been there for a long time and he told me that he was going to come back to my house. He said, ""I'll be here for the rest of my life."" I asked him if he could go back in time to help me get out of that situation."	2020-12-11 06:13	0	1

One of them was a guy who had a crush on a girl, and one of his friends was the one who got into a fight with another girl. The other guy was like, “what?” And then he started talking to her about how he was going to kill her. She then started to talk to him about what she was doing and how she wanted him to be friends with her boyfriend. He then stopped talking about it and said that it was okay to go out with him.	2020-12-11 06:10	0	1
