&amp,#x200B,


I miss being a kid, but I don't have a lot of friends. I miss having friends, and being able to meet new people. It's hard to be friends with someone who doesn't care about you. But I do have friends who are close to me, so I guess it's more of a part of my life.  

 I'm not a big fan of being around other people, because I've been around them for a long time and I feel like I need to get away from them. And I think that's the only thing I can do to make them happy in the long run.)

I wish I could go back to my parents when I was a kid, but I don't think I'd be able to do that now.  



  I'm not sure how I would have done it if I didn't have to. I just want to be a good parent, and I have a lot of respect for the people I care about. It's not a big deal to me, it's just a matter of how much I love them and what they think of me.

It's a common name for a lot of animals, but I think it's more common than it is for other animals. For example, if you have a dog that looks like a cat, you call it the "cat" because it has a name like that. It's also common for the dog to name itself.)
